                                I can testify to this because I was a prisoner for more than a decade. I've seen first
                                hand the affect that hearing someones voice can have on a man that may not have talked
                                to someone in days, weeks, and sometimes even months. The joy of talking to a relative
                                or friend while incarcerated sometimes can't even be put into words. But not every one
                                gets the chance to talk to someone outside of the prison.

                                Some inmates get abandoned by loves ones and will not have anyone to speak outside of
                                the walls they are confined in. I'm personally taking it into my hands to do what I can
                                to help men and women in these situations.</p>
